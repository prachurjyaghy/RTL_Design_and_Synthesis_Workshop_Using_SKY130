# RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_Workshop_Using_SKY130

## The agenda of this workshop is to understand the RTL Design and Synthesis process in VLSI using various open-source tools. This process is where we provide the synthesis netlist to the Physical Design team. By the end of this workshop, we will be able to understand how logic conversion takes place from a simple verilog code written for any level of logic.


## DAY 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### L1 - Learn about open-source simulator "iverilog"

### L2 - Start with Yosys and Sky130 PDKs


## DAY 2: Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

### L1 - Understanding timing .libs

### L2 - Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis

### L3 - Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization


## DAY 3: Combinational and sequential optimizations

### L1 - Introduction to optimizations

### L2 - Combinational logic optimizations

### L3 - Sequential logic optimizations

### L4 - Sequential optimizations for unused outputs



## DAY 4: GLS blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

### L1 - GLS blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch statements



## DAY 5: Optimization in synthesis

### L1 - If Case constructs

### L2 - For loop and for generate
