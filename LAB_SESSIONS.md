# DAY 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

## D1SK1 - Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog

### L1 - Introduction to iverilog design test bench


### Labs usign Yosys and Sky130 PDKs
  1. Launch Yosys in verilog_files directory
  2. Now read the lib and the netlist for the good_mux
  3. The top module is good_mux which reads it from the netlist
  4. No proc in the good_mux file, so this is only a combo logic
  5. Generate the RTL netlist for this module. THis will be realised using the .lib file which as the cells/ gates required to complete the logic
  6. The final shows the inputs and outputs

  7. Show will display the process
